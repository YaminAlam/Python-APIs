## Observerbale Trends

The temperature rises as the latitude centers, particularly between latitude values of 20 and 30, and only decreases as the latitude goes away from those values in either direction.

There is no dicsernable correlation between latitude level and cloudiness percentage. 

Extreme latitudes tend to produce higher windspeeds.

High humidity is concentrated between latitudes of 0 to 60
